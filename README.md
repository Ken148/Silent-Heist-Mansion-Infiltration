###  Introduction
### Game Summary:
Silent Heist: Mansion Infiltration is a stealth-based action game set in a sprawling mansion guarded by FBI agents. The player assumes the role of a professional thief who has been tasked by their mysterious boss to retrieve an unknown, highly valuable item from the mansion. The mission is clear: sneak in undetected, acquire the item, and escape without being caught. Every move must be carefully calculated, as detection means failure. The game combines tense stealth mechanics with puzzle-solving elements and environmental interaction to create an intense, immersive experience.

### Inspiration:
Inspired by stealth-action games like Hitman and Resident Evil 7, especially for its atmosphere and setting. The rainy, foreboding ambiance and detailed interior design of the mansion create a highly immersive environment, while the gameplay draws heavily from stealth titles where patience, timing, and planning are key.

### Player Experience:
Players will navigate the dimly lit corridors of the mansion, avoiding detection from patrolling FBI agents using stealth tactics such as hiding in shadows, distracting enemies, and hacking security systems. Success hinges on staying silent, using gadgets, and making smart decisions while under pressure.

### Platform:
The game will be released for Windows PC and built in Unity.

### Genre:
Single-player, stealth-action, with puzzle-solving elements.
Target Audience: Fans of stealth games and thrillers, such as Hitman and Metal Gear Solid.

### Concept
#### Gameplay Overview:
Players control a third-person 3D character with a WASD setup for movement, and mouse inputs (LMB and RMB) for interaction and use of gadgets.

### Theme Mechanics:
Players will have a set of tools to assist in their heist, including lockpicks, EMP grenades, and sound emitters to distract guards. Each tool is mapped to number keys and has limited uses.
Primary Mechanics:
Stealth:
Hide in the shadows or behind objects to avoid detection by guards. There is a light meter that indicates your visibility.

### Movement:
Use WASD for movement. Sneaking mode can be activated by holding Ctrl, reducing noise.

### Interaction:
Left Mouse Button (LMB) to interact with objects, pick locks, or take the item.
Right Mouse Button (RMB) to use gadgets or tools.

### Sound Awareness:
Guards will respond to noises, so the player must manage sound levels carefully. Rain sounds, muffled footsteps, and distant thunder can help mask the player's movements.

### Art
Theme Interpretation:
The game features dark, moody, realistic 3D graphics, emphasizing realism in a modern-day setting. The mansion is filled with rich details: dim lighting, flickering security cameras, and intricate decor create a tense atmosphere.

### Design:
The art style focuses on realism, with intricate textures for the environment and atmospheric lighting. Rain-soaked windows, polished wooden floors, and luxurious but eerie halls emphasize the contrast between the lavish setting and the danger lurking within.
### Audio
#### Sound Effects:
The game features realistic sound design, with heavy emphasis on environmental sounds. Rain pattering against windows, thunder rumbling in the distance, footsteps echoing in empty hallways, and the rustle of FBI agents' tactical gear all immerse the player in the experience.

### Music:
A minimal, suspenseful soundtrack that intensifies during moments of near detection, maintaining a constant feeling of tension.

### Game Experience
UI:
The UI is minimal, displaying the player's current health, gadget availability, and an objective marker. The design is sleek and modern, fitting the theme of a high-stakes heist. The UI will fade when not needed to avoid clutter.

### Controls:
Movement: WASD
Sneak: Ctrl (Hold)
